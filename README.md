# Statamic Courses

## Overview

> If you want to create a simple yet customizable online course using Statamic then this is for you!

You'll need to add *both* of these packages to your Statamic project:

- [Statamic Courses Starter Kit](https://statamic.com/starter-kits/anthony-gore/courses-starter-kit) (a free starter kit)
- [Statamic Courses Addon](https://statamic.com/addons/anthony-gore/courses) (a paid addon)

## Features
 
- Courses and lessons are customizable content types 
- Views are Antlers with custom tags allowing flexible design and UX 
- Configurable enrollment flow so you can have free or paid courses, memberships, etc

Note that we don't (yet?) provide these features out-of-the-box so you'll have to integrate them yourself if you need them: 

- Payments and billing
- Quizzes
- Assignments
- Certificates

## Getting started

Check the [documentation](https://statamic.com/addons/anthony-gore/courses/docs) for installation instructions.
